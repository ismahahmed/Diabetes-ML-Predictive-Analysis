# Diabetes-ML-Predictive-Analysis

## Introduction

This repository presents an analysis of diabetes data with the aim of predicting diabetes in individuals using machine learning and data analytics principles. The analysis includes the exploration of various features, correlation analysis, and statistical summaries. 

The primary aim of this project is to assess the accuracy of predictive models trained using the dataset. By employing different machine learning algorithms, we seek to evaluate their efficacy in predicting the occurrence of diabetes based on the available features.

**Data Source**: The data I will be using for this analysis is found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/predict-diabities/data). This dataset was originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. Things to note about the data: All individuals in the dataset are female, at least 21 years old and of Pima Indian Heritage.

## Scope of Analysis

* Data Exploration: Examination of feature distributions, correlation analyses, and statistical summaries.
* Model Training: Training and optimization of machine learning models utilizing the dataset features.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluation of model performance metrics to determine the most accurate predictive algorithm for diabetes prediction.
* Conclusion: Summary of findings and implications for diabetes prediction and healthcare practices.

## The Dataset

The *diabetes.csv* dataset includes 768 patients information spanning the following features:

* Pregnancies - Number of times pregnant (Integer | Discrete)
* Glucose - Plasma Glucose Concentration (Integer | Continuous)
* Blood Pressure - Diastolic Blood Pressure (Integer | Continuous)
* Skin Thickness - Skin Thickness (Integer | Continuous)
* Insulin - 2-Hour Serum Insulin (Integer | Continuous)
* BMI - Body Mass Index (Float | Coninuous)
* Diabetes Pedigree Function - Diabetes Pedigree Function (Float | Continuous)
* Age - Age (years) (Integer | Continuous)
* Outcome - Class variable (0 or 1) (Integer | Discrete)
